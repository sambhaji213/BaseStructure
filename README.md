Android volley is a networking library was introduced to make networking calls much easier, faster without writing tons of code. By default all the volley network calls works asynchronously, so we donâ€™t have to worry about using asynctask anymore. 

Volley comes with lot of features. Some of them are  
1. Request queuing and prioritization 
2. Effective request cache and memory management 
3. Extensibility and customization of the library to our needs 
4. Cancelling the requests
